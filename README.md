# tw-export-villages-csv
export villages-players-tribes data in a merged csv-file

motivation is to automate merging village-player-tribe data into a single csv file.
Later, such a file can be used to recover not only village data but also owner nickname and tribe from a given coordinates xxx|yyy. This might be helpful to use within excel "vlookup" function.
